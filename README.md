# nature_methods_multicut_pipelineThis repository contains the software used for the publication about the Multicut pipeline in Nature Methods (TODO exact reference here).It is a snapshot of the state of the software we developed for this publication.Since then, we have reimplemented some functionality in an open-source C++ pipeline (https://github.com/DerThorsten/nifty) and reimplemented the pipeline code for processing large volumes (https://github.com/constantinpape/McLuigi).Also, there is a beta version of an interactive multicut workflow in ilastik (http://ilastik.org/).While we might still develop in this repository, we do not guarantee for the functionality beyond the first release (v1) that corresponds to the state of the software at submission of the publication.If you are interested in using Multicut for your data and can't make it work with any of the options suggested here, please do not hesitate to contact us.## InstallationFor installation instructions see software directory.
