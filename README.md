# nature_methods_multicut_pipelineThis repository contains the software used for the publication about the Multicut pipeline in Nature Methods (TODO exact reference here).It is a snapshot of the state of the software we developed for this publication.Since then, we have reimplemented some functionality in an open-source C++ pipeline (https://github.com/DerThorsten/nifty) and reimplemented the pipeline code for processing large volumes (https://github.com/constantinpape/McLuigi).Also, there is a beta version of an interactive multicut workflow in ilastik (http://ilastik.org/).While we might still develop in this repository, we do not guarantee for the functionality beyond the first release (v1) that corresponds to the state of the software at submission of the publication.You can find jupyter notebooks with examples for the core functionality of the pipeline in the examples directory.If you are interested in using Multicut for your data and can't make it work with any of the options suggested here, please do not hesitate to contact us.## InstallationWe provide precompiled binaries at http://files.ilastik.org/multicut/.The software was packaged with conda.To install the multicut software (and dependencies) tp your own conda environment, use this command:$ conda install --name my-env --channel ilastik multicut_pipelineIn fact, this entire tarball can be reproduced with the following commands:$ conda create --name multicut-software --channel ilastik multicut_pipeline$ tar -czf multicut-software.tar.gz $(conda info --root)/envs/multicut-softwareFor build recipes of individual packages, refer to the source repository:https://github.com/ilastik/nature_methods_multicut_pipelineNote: Development is recommended on Mac/Linux platforms only, using conda-build v2.      Reproducing these binary pacakges on Windows requires a special version of conda-build.
