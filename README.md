# nature_methods_multicut_pipelineThis repository contains the software used for the publication about the Multicut pipeline in Nature Methods (TODO exact reference here).It is a snapshot of the state of the software we developed for this publication.Since then, we have reimplemented some functionality in an open-source C++ pipeline (https://github.com/DerThorsten/nifty) and reimplemented the pipelineing code for processing large volumes (https://github.com/constantinpape/McLuigi).While we might still keep on developing in this repository, we do not provide any support beyond the first release (v1) that corresponds to the state of the software at submission of the publication.## Install with condaWe provide a conda package...TODO## Install from local sourcesTODO Stuart
