# Welcome! 
Antipasti is HCI's deep learning library built on Theano for Image Processing. This is a stripped down version of Antipasti, comprising only the methods required to build and train ICv1.

[This](https://github.com/nasimrahaman/Antipasti) will be our future Github repository with the full version + documentation.
